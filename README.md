An advanced, highly customizable password generator that runs in your browser.
ChatGPT helped me create it.

# PLEASE FORK AND IMPROVE
I'm not a great programmer and I don't plan to update this at all, but a program like this could be very useful. However, while it is functional, it doesn't look as good as it should, and one of the features is broken. If you're able to, please fork this and add a bunch of improvements and make it a super-amazing password generator that anyone can use to easily generate passwords with advanced features and customization without needing to install KeePass.
